"""Biological age calculation engine.

Implements PhenoAge (Levine et al. 2018) and GrimAge surrogate estimation
from standard blood biomarkers. Pure computation — no LLM or database calls.

PhenoAge reference: Levine et al., "An epigenetic biomarker of aging for
lifespan and healthspan", Aging 2018; 10(4):573-591.

The original PhenoAge coefficients (from dayoonkwon/BioAge R package) expect
SI units: albumin g/L, creatinine μmol/L, glucose mmol/L, ln(CRP mg/L).
This module accepts standard US clinical units (g/dL, mg/dL, mg/dL, mg/L)
and converts internally before applying coefficients.
